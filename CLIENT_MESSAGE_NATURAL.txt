Hey,

Frontend is integrated with the JSON API v2 endpoints. Everything looks good on my end.

Getting 401 errors when hitting the JSON API. The token I'm using works for admin-api but doesn't have permissions for json-api endpoints.

Quick question - does the JSON API need authentication? If yes, should I use the same JWT token approach as admin-api, or is there a different way to authenticate?

Let me know and I'll get it sorted.

Thanks
