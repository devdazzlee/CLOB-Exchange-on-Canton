# ⏳ Waiting for Client Response

## Message Sent to Client

Message sent asking about JSON API authentication method.

## What We're Waiting For

Client to clarify:
1. Does JSON API require authentication?
2. What authentication method to use?
3. Keycloak client/scopes if JWT is needed

## Current Status

✅ Frontend ready
✅ API integration complete (v2 endpoints)
✅ Authentication code implemented
⏳ Waiting for correct authentication method

## Next Steps (After Client Response)

Once client responds, we'll:
1. Update authentication based on their answer
2. Test the implementation
3. Complete the integration

**Status:** Ready to implement once we have the authentication details.
