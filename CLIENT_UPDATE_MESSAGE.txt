Hi,

Great news! I've completed the implementation to make the OrderBook global, exactly as you requested - like Hyperliquid and Lighter.

## What's Been Fixed

✅ **Global OrderBook Implementation**
- One OrderBook per trading pair (shared by ALL users)
- All users see and interact with the same OrderBook
- Orders are matched across all users (proper CLOB behavior)
- Users can no longer create their own OrderBooks

## How It Works Now

1. **Operator creates OrderBooks** - Using an admin script, the operator initializes one OrderBook per trading pair (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, etc.)

2. **Users discover OrderBooks** - The frontend automatically discovers available OrderBooks via backend API

3. **All users share the same OrderBook** - When users place orders, they're added to the same global OrderBook that everyone can see

4. **Orders match across users** - Orders from different users match with each other, just like Hyperliquid and Lighter

## Technical Changes

- Updated DAML contract to make OrderBooks globally observable
- Added backend API endpoints for OrderBook discovery
- Updated frontend to use global OrderBooks
- Disabled user creation of OrderBooks
- Created admin script for operator to initialize OrderBooks

## Build Status

✅ DAML project compiled successfully
✅ DAR file ready for deployment
✅ All code tested and verified

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. The OrderBook now works exactly like Hyperliquid and Lighter - one global OrderBook per trading pair that all users share.

Let me know if you'd like to test it or if you have any questions!
