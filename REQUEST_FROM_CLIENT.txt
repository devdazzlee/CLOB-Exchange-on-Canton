Hi,

The frontend integration is complete, but I need the correct JWT token for the JSON API.

Current token has wrong permissions (audience="account" instead of "json-api").

Please provide:

1. JWT token with correct audience/scopes for JSON API access
   OR
2. Keycloak client ID and scopes needed for JSON API, and I'll generate the token

Once I have the correct token, I'll update it and complete testing.

Thanks!
