Hi,

I'm getting 403 Forbidden errors when querying contracts from the Canton JSON API. The token you provided has the correct scopes but lacks query permissions.

I need a JWT token that allows querying contracts via /v2/state/active-contracts endpoint.

Could you please:
1. Check Keycloak configuration for query permissions
2. Provide a new token with proper query/read access
3. Or let me know if there's a different authentication method for query operations

The frontend is ready, but I can't complete testing without being able to query contracts.

Thanks!
