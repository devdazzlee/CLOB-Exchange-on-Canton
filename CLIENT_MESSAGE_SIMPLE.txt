Hi,

Frontend integration with JSON API v2 is complete.

The JSON API endpoints are returning 401 Unauthorized.

**Question:** What authentication method should be used for JSON API?

1. Does JSON API require authentication?
2. If yes, what's the proper authentication method? (Same JWT as admin-api, or different approach?)

Current token (for admin-api) doesn't have permissions for JSON API endpoints.

Please clarify the authentication setup for JSON API.

Thanks!
