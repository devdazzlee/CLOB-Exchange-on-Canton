Hey,

JSON API v2 integration is done. Getting 401 on the endpoints though.

Tested without auth - still 401, so it definitely needs authentication.

The JWT token I'm using works for admin-api but doesn't have permissions for json-api.

What's the right way to authenticate with json-api? Same token approach as admin-api, or something different? And what Keycloak client/scopes should I use?

Let me know and I'll implement it properly.

Thanks
