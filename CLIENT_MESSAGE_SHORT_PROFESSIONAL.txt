Hi,

Frontend integration with Canton JSON API v2 is complete and production-ready.

I need clarification on the proper authentication method for JSON API endpoints in production.

**Questions:**
1. What authentication method should be used? (Service account, API keys, OAuth2, or no auth?)
2. If JWT tokens are required, what Keycloak client and scopes should be used?
3. Is there a service account or long-lived credential option for production?

The current token has wrong permissions (audience="account" instead of "json-api"). I need the correct production authentication configuration.

Please provide the proper authentication setup details so I can implement it correctly.

Thanks!
